# Product Context

## Why This Exists

### The Problem
Modern software development often involves complex, multi-faceted features that could be parallelized but aren't due to coordination overhead. Traditional development workflows are serial, with developers working sequentially or with manual coordination that's error-prone and slow.

### The Solution
PAOS enables true parallel development by:
- Automatically decomposing complex requirements into parallelizable tasks
- Orchestrating multiple AI agents to work on different aspects simultaneously
- Managing isolation and integration automatically
- Providing oversight without requiring constant manual intervention

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
1. **Minimal Setup**: Simple configuration, automatic environment setup
2. **Clear Visibility**: Real-time dashboard showing what each agent is doing
3. **Easy Control**: Intuitive REPL commands for managing agents
4. **Safe Experimentation**: Isolated worktrees prevent breaking main development
5. **Conflict-Free Merging**: Proactive detection and resolution of conflicts

### For Teams
1. **Faster Development**: Parallel execution of independent tasks
2. **Reduced Coordination**: Automated conflict detection and merge ordering
3. **Better Reviews**: AI-assisted PR review with context awareness
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all agent actions

## How It Should Work

### Typical Workflow
1. Developer provides PRD (Product Requirements Document)
2. PAOS analyzes and decomposes into structured tasks
3. System identifies parallelizable task groups
4. Spawns Claude Code agents in isolated worktrees
5. Agents work in parallel with real-time monitoring
6. Developer can interact with any agent directly
7. System detects potential conflicts proactively
8. Coordinates merging in dependency-aware order
9. Creates well-documented PRs for review

### User Interactions
- **Initial Setup**: `(paos/core:load-config)` to load configuration
- **Start Work**: Provide PRD file for decomposition
- **Monitor**: View dashboard showing agent progress
- **Intervene**: Use REPL to pause, redirect, or chat with agents
- **Review**: Get AI-assisted insights on PRs and merge order
- **Complete**: Coordinated merging and PR creation

### Key Principles
- **Transparency**: Always show what's happening
- **Control**: Human always has final say
- **Safety**: Isolation prevents catastrophic errors
- **Intelligence**: AI helps but doesn't dictate
- **Reliability**: State persistence and recovery from failures
