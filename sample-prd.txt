# Sample PRD for PAOS Testing

## Overview
This is a sample Product Requirements Document to test the PAOS task decomposition engine.

## Goals
- Test the Taskmaster CLI integration
- Verify YAML output parsing
- Ensure error handling works properly

## Requirements
1. The system should accept PRD files in various formats
2. Task decomposition should work with the Taskmaster CLI
3. Output should be properly parsed and validated
4. Error conditions should be handled gracefully

## Implementation Notes
- Use external process calls to run task-master
- Parse YAML output using cl-yaml
- Handle various error conditions
- Provide fallback mechanisms
